<p>This project involves analyzing a dataset of student performance metrics to gain insights into student grades and academic performance. The analysis is conducted in Python, using the Pandas library to clean and manipulate the data, and various statistical functions to explore and summarize the data.</p>
<p>The first step in the analysis is to collect the data, which is provided in the new_student_data.csv file. The data is read into a Pandas DataFrame using the read_csv function and the os.path.join function. Next, the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involves checking for and replacing missing values, removing unnecessary characters from the "grade" column, and converting the "grade" column to an integer data type. Once the data is cleaned and prepared, it is summarized using various statistical functions. To explore the data further, various data subsets are examined using the iloc and loc functions. Finally, comparisons are made within the data using the groupby function.</p>
<p>Through this analysis, we've gained insights into student grades and academic performance, and identified areas where improvements can be made. The code used in this analysis is available in the student_data_analysis.py file, and can be adapted for use with other datasets.</p>
